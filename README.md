# Motivation and Purpose

If you want partitions to be automatically mounted on your App VMs in Qubes OS, you'll have to manually do so. You'll also have to unmount it when you are done using it. 

This collection of Shell Scripts should be useful to configure your VMs to accept a list of partitions or other mass storage devices by label or uuid and mount them every time they're attached, as well as unmount them every time they are no longer there.

It is in early development. See issues page for more information.
